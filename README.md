# circuit-segments
Several schematics collected to show how common circuit elements are setup. The intent is that these designs can be used to inspire student-designed circuits.

## KiCAD designs
You'll need to have [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) installed to use these designs (they may be a good fit for copy/paste into your work.) Everything was designed to work with the standard library, and schematic elements without footprints were preferred. That way you can choose your own footprint more easily, if you are going to make these into real circuits.
